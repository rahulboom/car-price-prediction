# car-price-prediction
car price prediction using random forest regressor
understanding my data :


Using df.shape, df.columns, and df.head(), I’m able to see what features I’m working with and what each feature entails.
By using df.shape I found that my rows=1091 and columns=9
By using df. head() we can see the first 5 datas of my data sets.
From which we visualize the the column and rows .
By using df.describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values.
